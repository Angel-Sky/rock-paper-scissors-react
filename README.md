# Rock-Paper-Scissors - online game with ReactJS

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, but in this online version the user plays against the computer. 
Each player chooses one of three shapes - rock, paper or scissors. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (rock crushes scissors), but will lose to one who has played paper (paper covers rock); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (scissors cuts paper). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 
The winner of the game is the one who first score 3 points!
